1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,316
<b>This time we are in the mighty Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates , in the middle east</b>

2
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:16,516
<b>It's uh stinking hot here, it's not humid it's, it's kinda nice</b>

3
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:18,316
<b>Still you can definitely feel it</b>

4
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:20,266
<b>I'm in this weirdly vertical city</b>

5
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:22,283
<b>For a tech conference that Thoughtworks have sent me to</b>

6
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:25,616
<b>They paid for everything, flights accomodation and the ticket to enter</b>

7
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:26,483
<b>So that's pretty cool!</b>

8
00:00:26,483 --> 00:00:30,433
<b>Today we have to start with the mighty tallest building in the world the Burj</b>

9
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,699
<b>Of course you know we're going up</b>

10
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:41,316
<b>Build up cause they can't possibly build out</b>

11
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:43,233
<b>I'm keen for that fountain show</b>

12
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:02,500
<b>That city is absolutely. fucking. bussing.</b>

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,383
<b>It's conference day!</b>

14
00:01:04,383 --> 00:01:06,266
<b>I'm a delegate, dunno what that means</b>

15
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,516
<b>Guess I'll look around</b>

16
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:36,650
<b>I'm checking out the Zabeel park, right beneath the Dubai Frame</b>

17
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,816
<b>Then hopefully we're gonna go up the frame</b>

18
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:39,683
<b>And then checkout the Glowing Garden</b>

19
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:45,250
<b>Have you ever seen a public park that you entered using a</b>

20
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:48,183
<b>Tap and go, public transport card</b>

21
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,549
<b>Well now I have</b>

22
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,016
<b>That.. Doesn't look real</b>

23
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:54,266
<b>Such a weird thing to see</b>

24
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,650
<b>Let me in
Let me in!</b>

25
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:06,833
<b>I really just gotta, I just gotta</b>

26
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,666
<b>It's walkable glass</b>

27
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,283
<b>Nuh</b>

28
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:23,500
<b>Well that was pretty cool and only a couple of bucks</b>

29
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:25,900
<b>And this is The Glowing Gardens</b>

30
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,983
<b>Yayyyy</b>

31
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:42,583
<b>Aw</b>

32
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:45,066
<b>Oil pumps</b>

33
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:48,416
<b>Totally reasonable, for Dubai</b>

34
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,583
<b>Hwuh, Not your climate friends</b>

35
00:02:50,883 --> 00:02:52,550
<b>Ludicrous speed! </b>

36
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,533
<b>Well, I really enjoyed this little park</b>

37
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:58,050
<b>It's, such a nifty little thing, it's huge</b>

38
00:02:58,116 --> 00:03:00,266
<b>Anyway, next up I guess</b>

39
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:12,783
<b>So today I'm out in the desert</b>

40
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,349
<b>About a good two hours from Dubai</b>

41
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,266
<b>Near the border with Oman</b>

42
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:18,983
<b>For a day of fun in the sun</b>

43
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:21,616
<b>Be doing some quadbiking, some sandsurfing, camel riding</b>

44
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:23,883
<b>And probably getting sunburnt, Let's go!</b>

45
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:40,566
<b>What a unit</b>

46
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,766
<b>Not bad, not bad at all</b>

47
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,116
<b>We're ah, off roading? Four wheel driving?</b>

48
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:55,716
<b>Flat tyres..?</b>

49
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,366
<b>Shit</b>

50
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:24,699
<b>Hello</b>

51
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:26,666
<b>Hello Australia</b>

52
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,333
<b>(Unintelligible) Dubai?</b>

53
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,149
<b>Let's go!</b>

54
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:40,866
<b>Woooo!</b>

55
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,300
<b>Camels how ya dune?</b>

56
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,216
<b>Yeah yeah trust me</b>

57
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,483
<b>Trust you? Wayy</b>

58
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:50,283
<b>Oh what is this?</b>

59
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:53,833
<b>Shit</b>

60
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:14,399
<b>What better way, to juxtapose the desert</b>

61
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,216
<b>Than with the snow? That's right</b>

62
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,116
<b>I'm still in the U.A.E, infact I'm in a mall</b>

63
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:22,733
<b>Where they have an indoor skiing centre</b>

64
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,199
<b>But yeah how cool's that? And it's like, pretty affordable</b>

65
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,800
<b>Here it was a hundred bucks, not bad</b>
<b>With gear</b>

66
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,016
<b>Let's go hit the slopes</b>

67
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,466
<b>Look at my long pole!</b>

68
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:32,216
<b>Yesss</b>

69
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:35,916
<b>Perfect, yep</b>

70
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,350
<b>Slow?</b>
<b>That means fast</b>

71
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,533
<b>Not behd</b>

72
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:46,016
<b>There's not just skiing around here there's a few other things, like this one</b>

73
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:46,966
<b>Pingu</b>

74
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,033
<b>Yes jump in</b>

75
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:57,199
<b>Have a good one</b>

76
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:03,483
<b>My ass!</b>

77
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,616
<b>Yeah I'd do that again</b>

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,199
<b>Today I'm at Al Seef</b>

79
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:13,883
<b>Which is kinda like, South Bank of Dubai</b>

80
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:16,583
<b>It's old Dubai, a lot of the buildings around here are really old</b>

81
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,366
<b>The city used to be a fishing village</b>

82
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:19,816
<b>Nowadays it's kinda like a heritage</b>

83
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:21,633
<b>There's shops but no one running them</b>

84
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,766
<b>I'm starting to think maybe it's like a prayer time right now</b>

85
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:34,266
<b>Could use a motor, or</b>

86
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:34,600
<b>Oar</b>

87
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:35,216
<b>Oar</b>

88
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,683
<b>Oar</b>

89
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:36,199
<b>Oar</b>

90
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:36,683
<b>Oar</b>

91
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:38,899
<b>Naw this is fantastic</b>

92
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,216
<b>Unfettered capitalism wins again</b>

93
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:42,550
<b>Don't even need a helmet</b>

94
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:47,716
<b>That is the discount flap thingy they have ziptied to the handlebars</b>

95
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:50,933
<b>[Sigh]</b>

96
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,600
<b>On the ferry, heading around the top of the coast line</b>

97
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:22,183
<b>Is it just me or does a lot of these building look very empty?</b>

98
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,583
<b>Can't believe I forgot my telescope at home but you can kinda tell</b>

99
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:30,866
<b>Apparently I saved 50% by buying a ticket 2 minutes before the "sunset tax" comes in so..</b>

100
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,416
<b>Let's have a look</b>

101
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,816
<b>Well, so comes the end of yet another trip</b>

102
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:46,966
<b>Been an excellent, 6ish days</b>

103
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:49,966
<b>I've done nothing, really, except tour around</b>

104
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:50,766
<b>Fricken sweat</b>

105
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:52,466
<b>Sweat and breathe fumes</b>

106
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,033
<b>And I reckon one day if I ever came back one day with money it would be a completely different experience</b>

107
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:59,333
<b> But for this time, thanks Dubai it's been great</b>

108
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,333
<b>Seeya next time</b>

109
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:23,566
<b>It's gettin a bit loud</b>

110
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:25,949
<b>Oh my god</b>

111
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:28,033
<b>ahh</b>

112
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:30,333
<b>Ahhhhh</b>

113
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:32,399
<b>AHH</b>
